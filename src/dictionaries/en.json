      "descriptionTwo": "We are proud to say that we contribute our grain of sand to fair trade and local commerce, fostering and promoting natural and sustainable consumption.",
      "descriptionThree": "At Árbore we work with a multitude of products of ecological origin. In our store in Vigo you can find everything from food products to cosmetics, through hygiene items, nutritional supplements and a long etcetera.",
      "descriptionFour": "Our principles feed into each other, so we are sure that it makes them much more solid. Local trade encourages fair trade, in the same way that environmentalism encourages vegetarianism or fair trade encourages environmentalism itself.",

An intensive agriculture based on optimizing production throughout the 12 months of the year will never, for obvious reasons, respect the environment or the product itself.",
      "descriptionThree": "The basis of responsible consumption is, after all, consuming consciously and in accordance with our ethical principles. That is why at Árbore we are committed to fair and local trade.
